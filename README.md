## Way-Fair-Project
#Bringing Customers
This is a project for Way Fair company that i did as part of their data science competition. The goal was to build two models to 
predict customer behavior : 1) which customers would purchase from WayFair by the end of then month?
                            2) the expected revenue the buying customers would spend? 
I had two datasets with various information on the customers including sales call records, purchase history, etc.
