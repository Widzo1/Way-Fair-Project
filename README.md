# Way-Fair-Project
Bringing Customers
This is a project for WayFair company which i did as part of a data science competition. The goal was to build two models to 
predict the probability that a customer will purchase from WayFair in the next 30 days as well as the expected revenue spent in the 
next 30 days by each customer. I had two datasets with various information on the customers, sales call records and purchase history
that i worked with to build the models.
